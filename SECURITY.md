## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Security-First Approach

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please help us protect our users by following responsible disclosure practices.

### How to Report

**üö® DO NOT create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities**

Instead, please:

1. **Email us directly**: Send details to the maintainer's secure email
2. **Use GitHub Security Advisories**: Report through GitHub's private vulnerability reporting
3. **Include detailed information**: Help us understand and reproduce the issue

### Information to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please provide:

- **Vulnerability Type**: SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.
- **Affected Components**: Specific files, functions, or features
- **Attack Vector**: How the vulnerability can be exploited
- **Impact Assessment**: What an attacker could accomplish
- **Proof of Concept**: Steps to reproduce (if safe to include)
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for remediation
- **Affected Versions**: Which plugin versions are vulnerable

### Example Report Template

```
Subject: Security Vulnerability in Advanced Bulk Content Management

Plugin Version: 0.2.0
Vulnerability Type: SQL Injection
Severity: High

Description:
The bulk edit functionality is vulnerable to SQL injection through the custom field filter parameter.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to bulk content manager
2. Apply custom field filter with malicious SQL
3. Execute bulk action

Impact:
An authenticated attacker could extract sensitive data from the database.

Suggested Fix:
Implement proper sanitization using $wpdb->prepare() for all SQL queries.
```

### Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports according to the following timeline:

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Within 3 business days
- **Fix Development**: Within 7-14 days (depending on complexity)
- **Security Release**: Within 21 days of initial report
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is widely deployed (typically 30 days)

## Security Measures

### Current Security Features

#### Input Validation and Sanitization
- **All user inputs** are sanitized using WordPress functions
- **SQL queries** use prepared statements via `$wpdb->prepare()`
- **File uploads** are validated for type and size
- **URL parameters** are validated and sanitized

#### Authentication and Authorization
- **User capability checks** for all operations
- **Nonce verification** for form submissions
- **Role-based access control** for different features
- **Post ownership validation** before operations

#### Data Protection
- **Database queries** use WordPress APIs to prevent injection
- **Output escaping** prevents XSS attacks
- **CSRF protection** through WordPress nonces
- **File permissions** follow WordPress security standards

#### Secure Coding Practices
- **No direct file access** - all files check for WordPress context
- **Error handling** prevents information disclosure
- **Logging controls** to prevent log injection
- **Rate limiting** for resource-intensive operations
