## Features & Functionality

### Q: What bulk actions can I perform?
**A:** The plugin supports numerous bulk operations:
- **Content Management**: Edit, delete, publish, unpublish posts
- **Taxonomy Management**: Add/remove categories, tags, custom taxonomies
- **Meta Data**: Update custom fields and meta values
- **Author Management**: Change post authors in bulk
- **Media Management**: Set/remove featured images

- **Status Filters**: Published, draft, private, scheduled posts
- **Text Search**: Search in titles, content, excerpts

### Q: How many posts can I process at once?
**A:** The limit depends on your server configuration. By default, the plugin processes 50 posts per batch to avoid timeouts. You can adjust this in settings, but consider:
- Your PHP memory limit
- Server execution time limits
- Database performance
- For very large operations (1000+ posts), use the background processing feature

### Q: Does the plugin support scheduling?
**A:** Yes! You can schedule bulk operations for:
- **One-time execution**: Set specific date and time
- **Recurring operations**: Daily, weekly, monthly schedules
- **Conditional triggers**: Based on content age or events

### Q: Can I import/export data?
**A:** Yes, the plugin supports multiple formats:
- **CSV Import/Export**: Spreadsheet-compatible format
- **JSON Export**: Structured data format
- **WordPress XML**: Native WordPress export format
- **Custom Mapping**: Map fields during import

## Performance & Limitations

### Q: The plugin is slow with large datasets. How can I improve performance?
**A:** Try these optimization techniques:

**Server-side optimizations:**
```php
// Add to wp-config.php
ini_set('memory_limit', '512M');
ini_set('max_execution_time', 300);
ini_set('max_input_vars', 3000);
```

**Plugin settings:**
- Reduce batch size to 25-50 posts
- Enable background processing for large operations
- Use specific filters to reduce dataset size
- Schedule heavy operations during off-peak hours

### Q: I'm getting memory limit errors. What should I do?
**A:** Increase your PHP memory limit:

**Method 1: wp-config.php**
```php
ini_set('memory_limit', '512M');
define('WP_MEMORY_LIMIT', '512M');
```

**Method 2: .htaccess (Apache)**
```apache
php_value memory_limit 512M
```

**Method 3: Contact your hosting provider**
If you can't modify these settings, contact your hosting provider to increase the memory limit.

### Q: Operations are timing out. How can I fix this?
**A:** Timeout issues can be resolved by:

1. **Enable background processing** in plugin settings
2. **Reduce batch size** to 25 or fewer posts
3. **Increase execution time**:
   ```php
   ini_set('max_execution_time', 300); // 5 minutes
   ```
4. **Use scheduling** for large operations
5. **Break large operations** into smaller chunks

### Q: Can I undo bulk operations?
**A:** It depends on the operation:
- **Bulk Delete**: Posts go to trash and can be restored for 30 days
- **Bulk Edit**: No automatic undo, but you can export data before operations as backup
- **Status Changes**: Can be reversed with another bulk operation
- **Meta Updates**: No automatic undo (backup recommended)

**Best Practice**: Always backup your database before major bulk operations.

## Import/Export

### Q: What file formats are supported for import?
**A:** Supported formats:
- **CSV**: Comma-separated values (most common)
- **JSON**: JavaScript Object Notation
- **XML**: WordPress export format
- **TXT**: Tab-delimited text files

### Q: How do I prepare a CSV file for import?
**A:** Your CSV should include these columns:
```csv
title,content,author,status,categories,tags,custom_field_1
"Post Title","Post content here","admin","publish","Category1,Category2","tag1,tag2","Custom Value"
```

**Tips:**
- Use quotes around text with commas
- Separate multiple categories/tags with commas
- Use author username or email
- Include custom field columns as needed

### Q: Can I import featured images?
**A:** Yes! Include a column with image URLs:
```csv
title,content,featured_image
"Post Title","Content here","https://example.com/image.jpg"
```

The plugin will download and attach the images automatically.

### Q: Export is taking too long. What can I do?
**A:** For large exports:
1. Apply filters to reduce the dataset
2. Select only necessary fields for export
3. Use background processing if available
4. Consider exporting in smaller chunks

## User Management & Permissions

### Q: Can different user roles access the plugin?
**A:** Yes, but with different capabilities:
- **Administrator**: Full access to all features
- **Editor**: Can perform bulk actions on posts they can edit
- **Author**: Limited to their own posts
- **Custom Roles**: Configure specific permissions

### Q: How do I restrict access to certain features?
**A:** You can customize permissions using WordPress capabilities:
```php
// Only allow administrators to delete posts in bulk
if (!current_user_can('manage_options')) {
    // Remove delete action for non-admins
}
```

### Q: Can multiple users work on bulk operations simultaneously?
**A:** Yes, but consider:
- Each user sees operations they initiated
- Simultaneous operations on the same content may conflict
- Use user-specific filters to avoid conflicts
- Monitor system resources during concurrent operations

## Troubleshooting

### Q: The plugin interface is not loading correctly.
**A:** Check for these common issues:
